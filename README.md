# election-xml-to-csv-parser
A two part Node.js script that takes in an XML file about Finnish elections and outputs a CSV file with information about candidate double mandates.

The script can easily be modified to take into account any other data that may be presented in the XML file.

Run <code>npm install</code> to install relevant dependencies.

Run <code>node nodeXmlParser.js</code> to run the scripts.

Depending on the XML file size the execution may take a while.
